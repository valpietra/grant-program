## Project Overview 

- Project: Insurly - Decentralized Insurance For Real-World Assets
- Team Legal Name: Insurly Pte. Ltd.
- Payment Address: 0x4789E9DE50CCC9e63547FdE31A3fEBFBCdA21047

### Overview

Insurly is a decentralized insurance for real-world assets that tokenizes the risks you are exposed to, on-chain, and creates new economic opportunities for wider range of stakeholders. We are the first insurance-focused protocol with real-world applications and benefits, a bridge between tangible assets and your meta-identity. A phygital NFT, an NFT 2.0 with a strong utility and ethical principles.

Our ecosystem reimagines the world of insurance by going back to the insurance market roots as it was created in 1650 by Edward Lloyds in London; using risk pooling to offer protection to anyone at a fraction of the risk cost and redistribute the associated profits. Our vision is to create a new insurance world, where blockchain technology is used to give everyone a chance to get affordable insurance policies regardless of their financial resources and location. This is made possible by cutting high operating & distribution costs of the traditional form of insurance and through decentralization.

Imagine a world where you could get a personalized insurance cover, tailored to your needs, for the duration you want, accessible within a few minutes from your phone for a fraction of the price you are paying today. You could get a travel insurance while you are on the way to the airport for a 3-day weekend; a micro insurance to cover your computer and phone during a work trip against theft; or even a protection for a 2h bike ride in case of an accident.

The claim process will rely on smart contracts and will offer an automated, seamless and fully transparent experience. Once the pre-specified conditions are met, the next step in transaction or process is automatically triggered. There will be no delay, no fool play, no exception. The risk you are exposed to will be tokenized. You will be able to provide your insurance cover and all its relevant details to any private or public organization within seconds if required.

#### How can VeChain help and support us to solve the issues of the traditional insurance model?
The insurance ecosystem is the only industry which has not yet been improved using blockchain technology. As a highly automatable platform for efficient economics systems, blockchain is well-suited to disrupt this industry. We believe that by leveraging on VeChain ecosystem and technical excellence, we can have a significant impact to creat a viable end-to-end digital insurance solution.

An alternative system should offer the basic ingredients of any insurance system: covering expected losses, covering long tail risk, and covering transaction costs.

Insurly will use VeChain blockchain to impact and improve the following areas:
- Transparency, visibility, traceability
- Eliminate conflict of interest between the customers and the company 
- Reduced transaction costs
- Eliminate information asymmetry
- Access for insurance to more customers
- Access for insurance investors
- Efficiency and automation

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.
Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

### Ecosystem Fit
To our knowledge, that are no other similar product aiming to provide a decentralized insurance for real world assets. The closest solutions are only focusing on providing insurance services for protocol hack / nft / etc and do not provide coverage for tangible assets in the real world.

#### Milestone 1 — UI / UX, Website & Servers
1.1 UI / UX design for both the website platform and the mobile app. We already have our design agency ready to start and worked on the wireframes internally.
1.2 Website implementation, mainly static frontend work at this point of time. Will be used to communicate about the project. Backend will be developed under Milestone 2.
1.3 Includes server cost for 12 months.

#### Milestone 2 — Underwriting & Backend Development

#### Community engagement

We will keep our community up-to-date on the project on our social networks as well as on Medium. Medium will be used to provide weekly / monthly detailed articles on the project progression, how the team is working to overcome any potential roadblocks, etc.

## Future Plans

Insurance is currently transitioning from a “purchase and annual renewal” model to a more continuous cycle, with product offerings constantly adapting to an individual’s behavioral patterns. Furthermore, products are disaggregated substantially into micro-coverage elements (for example, phone battery insurance, flight delay insurance, different coverage for a washer and dryer within the home) that consumers can customize to their particular needs.

Once the MVP has been tested and we have a proven / working model, we will develop more insurance products to cover the shifting nature of living arrangements and travel. We will focus on usage-based insurance (UBI) as physical assets are more and more shared across multiple parties, with a pay-by-mile or pay-by-ride model for car sharing insurance and pay-by-stay insurance for home-sharing services, such as Airbnb.

Insurly will feature a decentralized marketplace where you can get classic and UBI covers for your real-world assets such as:
•	Micro insurance for daily life
•	Assets (furniture, car, etc)
•	Travel
•	NFT / Crypto
•	Health / Life

As we want Insurly policy marketplace to be accessible to both web3 experienced and neophyte users, we will offer a neat way for users to access the platform with familiar Web2 login methods through simple self-custodial authentication infrastructure. Mainstream audience will also be able to pay using a credit card and Insurly will handle the payment gateway process and token conversion to their wallet.

## Additional Information 

### Concept

Insurly has different components necessary to its daily operations:
- A Risk pool which holds the reserve collateral used to issue and underwrite insurance policies against insurable events. It’s funded by the premiums paid by the insured users.
- A Reinsurance pool which hold additional collateral and reinsures the risk pool against catastrophic long-tail events, which could unexpectedly deplete the risk pool or make it unable to issue new insurance policies. It’s funded by a percentage of the excess revenue from the risk pool as well as by the INSR token reinsurance investors.
- A Risk management system setup by our underwriters to ensure the insurance actuarial model is correctly assessed, tested and robust.
- A token marketplace where participants can purchase and redeem tokens.

The reinsurance pool will always hold a non-zero amount of collateral. The system is designed to limit the amount the total amount of risk underwritten to an amount no greater than the amount of collateral held by the reinsurance pool.

At the beginning, the reinsurance collateral is gathered through the initial mint of the Genesis collection, and thus the upper bound of the number of policies that can be underwritten with 100% collateral backing established.

The risk pool automatically underwrites policies until this upper bound of policies is reached, and then ceases to underwrites new ones. This is intended to ensure that every insurance policy is 100% collateralized and no customer can lose a payout to which they are entitled. We estimate that a $1M capitalization of the reinsurance pool will support a large enough throughput of policies than will likely be required in the early stages of the project.

To be able to handle daily operations, a minimum collateral reserve is required in the risk pool. Its value is determined by the insurance model. Insurance premiums are calculated as a function of this required collateral, the insurable event / risk and the desired payout for the policy. When purchasing a premium, a 5-10% fee will be applied toward operational costs.
